Sorry Argentina . I love you https://t.co/FIDNJAx9HX
Argentinian beliebers I would like nothing more than to bring the #purposetour there but until the legal conditions change there I can't.
And tonight #PurposeTourMontreal
On to better news. Watch out for the #Spotify #company campaign and music video this week.
Argentina I do love you. It is in fact one of my favorite places to tour. I wish this was not the case. My lawyers say it is what it is.
If things were to change I would love to come but at this time I cannot. For everyone else in South America I look forward to seeing you
