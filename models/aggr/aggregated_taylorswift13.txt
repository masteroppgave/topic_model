Then I realized I may have a problem.
I'll bet that when you see The Giver, you'll come away haunted by several things. One of those things will be Odeya Rush. @OdeyaRush1

Never played in Malaysia before tonight and I've been missing out- THANK YOU KL! Only one more show, then no more Red Tour......
I swallowed a strand of my hair and now everything is ruined.

Super weird how all of a sudden everyone is busy when I text them "hey want to come over and have a Scrabble tournament??"
It's crazy to think about how many countries I've lost hair ties in.
WOAH so it was definitely option A. Excellent work, Jakarta.
I can hear the crowd from my dressing room so either A) Jakarta crowds are the loudest EVER or B) Jakarta arenas have super thin walls.
The Tokyo show was a DREAM. Plus, we've added another show in Singapore on June 9th!! See you there! http://t.co/aox1ID193n

Tonight's surprise guest at the O2: Danny O'Donoghue from The Script singing 'Breakeven'. The crowd went absolutely insane!! #redtourlondon
Tonight at the O2, @samsmithworld sang my new favorite song "Money On My Mind" and smashed it! You need this song/artist in your life!

A Golden Globe nomination on my birthday... I think it's safe to say there will be no walking for me today, only skipping and frolicking.
It would appear that I'm now 24. That's on Australia time though. Still 23 in the States.
On another note, watching @cd_henderson try to cure a headache with Skittles and Red Bull before the show was truly inspiring.
Perth! Insane crowd! When you randomly all started singing happy birthday... Well played :)

To everyone who came to the show tonight in LA, I adore you. To anyone coming to the next 3 shows, expect more of the unexpected :)
One of my favorite moments of the night was @CherLloyd coming out to sing 'Want U Back'. The crowd went insane!! And she's such a fun girl!
Tonight at Staples was an absolute DREAM. @SaraBareilles came out to sing 'Brave', one of my favorite songs. And she completely smashed it!!

"My songs know what you did in the dark.. So light em up." @PatrickStump @falloutboy http://t.co/fMx0uxHd06
Tonight was a show I'll NEVER forget. That insane MetLife Stadium crowd and a surprise guest performance by @patrickstump of @falloutboy!!
I feel like I definitely get along with people roughly 45% more if they know all the words to 'You're So Vain' by Carly Simon.
Just landed in my home state- Pittsburgh, see you later on! I'll be the one in the sparkly red shoes singing about my feelings.
Im so excited that the new video for Red comes out this evening! Also very excited about all the red, white, &amp; blue happening tomorrow.
In Vancouver- just realized you guys got my twitter up to 30 million followers?!?! So cool considering I only tweet about my cat and food.
Then and now. @britmaack http://t.co/BhNauc93TG
So stoked to be playing the first show they've ever had in this stadium tonight- see you soon Winnipeg...
We've lost Chet Flippo, one of my favorite journalists, who devoted his life to writing about music from a place of integrity. So sad.
Happy Father's Day and a shout out to my fantastic dad for loving me even when I wore outfits like this. http://t.co/JqVwugKicy
Toronto. I love you. http://t.co/e0qArNVsa5
I'm beginning to think that you don't find happiness from living your life looking ahead or back..that you find it when you look around.
Just took a walk around the stadium we're playing in tonight in Toronto- It took a while. Two nights playing here?? No complaints.
I heard @caitlinbird running through the house screaming. At first I thought she was being murdered. Turned out she saw a rainbow outside.
Thanks @edsheeran for surprising the crowd and coming out to sing 'Everything Has Changed'. Everyone went INSANE. #CapitalSTB
Looking out into a crowd of 80,000 with their phones up, all lit up, was breathtaking. London. I just adore you. #CapitalSTB
Backstage at Wembley Stadium, eating candy, waiting to play later on- stoked for tonight! #CapitalSTB

That moment when you buy scissors and then you try to open them but you can't because you DON'T HAVE SCISSORS.
That San Antonio crowd was amazing and SO loud. Now I'm stuck in my own concert traffic, which is a conflicting feeling.
Oklahoma- the entire crowd in Austin, TX and I have you in our thoughts and prayers tonight.
Best. Night.
Billboards! On ABC! You watching?
Played Houston! Then rehearsed in Vegas for Billboards! Then cleaned my closet and concluded that roughly 79% of my shirts are striped.
About to watch the New Girl season finale and I totally would be even if I wasn't in this episode. @NewGirlonFOX
Oh my God. YES. #billboardmusicawards http://t.co/bp3u9Gz6IJ

That Lexington crowd was INCREDIBLE. And 17,000 strong. So happy right now.
Well said, @austinswift7. http://t.co/yFE1NFs1PA
So my TV remote is broken- which pretty much cancels my evening plans with detectives Benson and Stabler. And Eames and Goren. And Dr Grey.
Tampa. You were so loud and dancy, it's gonna take me a while to fall asleep after that one. So I will raid the fridge now. Obviously.
So cool that @bobatl came to the show last night and surprised the Atlanta crowd with 'Both of Us'! Insanely fun.
Bye Atlanta!! Love you! http://t.co/Koto85OkSR
Atlanta, you were an insane crowd-- see you tomorrow night? Excited.
This is my equivalent to a dragon guarding treasure. http://t.co/Z4xMfpj4h1

Leaving LA now after the best day with my friends. Almost forgot it was a video shoot. Can't wait for you guys to see it.
WE JUST WON A GRAMMY FOR SAFE AND SOUND!!!!!!!!!!
Favorite Grammy day moment so far: sitting in my dressing room with Sir Elton, watching @EdSheeran play new songs on his guitar.
Long day of rehearsals &amp;fittings for Grammys (stoked). Now I'm in bed at 8pm (again) and (still) blaming it on jet lag from the Europe trip.
I sang with Tim McGraw on a song on his new album- it's called 'Highway Don't Care' and it's out now and I'm psyched about it- check it out?
So I'm just minding my own business, making a sandwich before rehearsals, and I get a call that Red is platinum in the UK. I LOVE you guys.
3am. Jet lag. Whyyyyyyyyyyyy.
Thank you to all the fans in France and Spain for making this trip so lovely. Headed back to  now!
You never know when you might happen upon the most perfect carousel... http://t.co/J2Gxvfvu

It's official--'I Knew You Were Trouble' is #1 on pop radio!! You guys are unbelievable. I'm smiling SO big right now.

So excited to be in New York playing on @OfficialNYRE! It all starts at 8pm ET on ABC. Can't. even. verbalize. how stoked I am for 2013!
I shouldn't read into the fact that my family got me a new scrabble board (the one that swivels!) &amp;cat treats for Christmas, right? Am I 85?
Hiiii @lilyrosecooper--thanks! That just made my day:) Merry Christmas!
Was just thinking about how amazing it is that @ReeveCarney did all of his own stunts in the 'Trouble' video. So unbelievably talented.
I'm heartsick about the senseless tragedy in CT and praying for the families of the children and teachers who lost their lives. Unthinkable.
Best birthday surprise EVER-just found out that Safe&amp;Sound is nominated for a GOLDEN GLOBE!! Thank you @goldenglobes and HFPA! #hungergames

Just tried reading a hotel shampoo bottle an arms length away from my face to check if I still need contacts-Turns out I do. Eventful night.
Today my friend @RichardWilkins made the astute observation that 'Meredith' contains 'Red'.  I was astounded. And the fans were amazing.
Now we're off to Australia, where @GrantMickelson will undoubtedly refer to koalas as 'panda bears' no matter how many times we correct him.
Leaving Tokyo. I'll miss you guys. Thank you for your lovely hospitality and cat-related gifts. :)
I'm thankful for friendships like this. http://t.co/KKiS2IUO
Last night my band, crew, and I ate Japanese food and went around the table saying what we're thankful for. I could've gone on for an hour.
Time to play my nightly game of "where are the light switches in this hotel room?"
Landed in Japan a few hours ago- thank you to all the wonderful fans at the airport for your adorable gifts and adorable-ness in general :)
Thank you so much for the AMA! You're unreal. I went straight from the awards to a night video shoot. Long day but so worth it.
Getting ready for the AMAs! Maybe if you feel like it, you'll watch? 
Walked into my AMA dressing room and there was this little bowl of candy in there. Literally shrieked with excitement. Need to tone it down.

That show was like "EEEEEEEEEEE!!!" @BBCR1 Teen Awards. Wembley Arena. I'm in love with you, London. 
I feel like I'd be more understood if people knew 'I Don't Want to Miss a Thing' by Aerosmith is how most of my emotions sound in my head.
My glitter nail polish says 'party' but my sweat pants/bun on top of head ensemble say 'room service and journaling my feelings'.
I might be sleep walking. I'm definitely sleep walking.

MELBOURNE NIGHT 2- YOU WERE SO LOUD, I HAD TO WRITE IT IN ALL CAPS.  What a pleasure, getting to play for a crowd like that.
Night 1 of 3 in Melbourne was wonderful! Now watching a movie, eating Thai food. Hotel room life.
Night 1 in Sydney was earth-shatteringly loud. Can't wait for tonight's show!
Both shows in Brisbane were magical and wildly dancy. And so completely worth the trip.
Adelaide Was amazing. But now I'm stuck in a car with my two back up singers who will NOT STOP CHOMPING ON CORN NUTS AND IT IS SO LOUD.
The Lorax is opening in the theaters today! It's also Dr. Seuss's birthday. Maybe go see it please?
A perfect backstage evening, cutting my band mates' hair and getting ready to go play a show. Perth. I'm excited.
Hey so Zac and I are gonna be on @TheEllenShow today talking about The Lorax-- and other incredibly random things. And singing.
I'm gonna be on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, well, tonight.

SO excited about the @ACMAwards nominations! Yay! So wonderful.
As I mentioned in Vogue, Sarah Jaxheimer went to middle school with me and had great hair. She's a lovely girl. Blog sites, calm down.
Went to Sundance to see Rory Kennedy's documentary about her mother, @Ethel_Movie. It was moving, hilarious, and beautiful.
I AM SO EXCITED. www.Vogue.com
Apparently my only way of dealing with a remote control that isn't working right is to bang it on the table and scream 'COME ON!'
Thank you so much for my People's Choice Award! Favorite Country Artist! PARTY!!! Seriously- thank you for voting.
Thanks for wishing me luck at the Peoples Choice Awards tonight! I'm not there, but I'll be watching on tv from Nashville!

#SafeAndSound is trending!!
