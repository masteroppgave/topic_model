"It is surely the pursuit of peace that is most needed in this world so full of strife." #IranDeal
"As members of Congress reflect on their pending decision, I urge them to set aside political considerations. #IranDeal
"As Americans, we should be proud of this achievement." #IranDeal
"Now we have before us a solution that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon without resorting to war." #IranDeal
"President Kennedy warned Americans not to see conflict as inevitable. It is time to apply such wisdom. #IranDeal
"I have repeatedly challenged anyone opposed to this deal to put forward a better, plausible alternative." #IranDeal
"When we carefully examine the arguments against this deal, none of them stand up to scrutiny. #IranDeal
"If Iran violates this deal, we will have ample opportunity to respond." #IranDeal
"Worry less about being labeled weak. Worry more about getting it right. #IranDeal
"How can we in good conscience justify war before we have tested a diplomatic agreement that achieves our objectives?"
The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy or some sort of war. #IranDeal
Walk away from this agreement and you will get a better dealfor Iran. #IranDeal
Those who say we can walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy. #IranDeal
"We will continue to have sanctions in place on Iran's support for terrorism and violation of human rights. #IranDeal
There is no scenario where sanctions relief turns Iran into the region's dominate power. #IranDeal
An argument against sanctions relief is effectively an argument against any diplomatic solution. #IranDeal
"Without this deal, the scenarios that critics warn about happening in 15 years could happen six months from now."
"The bottom line is, if Iran cheats, we can catch themand we will." #IranDeal
This deal is not just the best choice among alternativesthis is the strongest non-proliferation agreement ever.
If Iran violates the agreement over the next decade all of the sanctions can snap back in to place. #IranDeal
"Iran has powerful incentives to keep its commitments." #IranDeal
"This deal shuts off the type of covert program Iran has pursued in the past. #IranDeal
"In July, we reached a comprehensive plan of action that meets our objectives." #IranDeal
"What was once proclaimed as a historic mistake is now held up as a success." #IranDeal
The progress of Iran's nuclear program was halted for the first time in a decade. #IranDeal
"It was diplomacy that ratcheted up the pressure on Iran." #IranDeal
"Winning this global buy-in was not easy. I know. I was there." #IranDeal
"What made our new approach more effective was our ability to draw upon new U.N. Security Council resolutions." #IranDeal
It was our very willingness to negotiate that helped America rally the world to our cause. #IranDeal
"I have also made clear my preference for a peaceful diplomatic resolution of the issue." #IranDeal
"Even before taking office, I made clear that Iran would not be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon on my watch." #IranDeal
"The question then is not whether to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but how." #IranDeal
