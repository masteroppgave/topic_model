As an astrophysicist, I suppose my day job is actually my night job.
A skeptic will question claims, then embrace the evidence. A denier will question claims, then reject the evidence.

Even more cosmic car names: Aerostar Apollo Aries Aurora Comet Focus Fusion Gemini Meteor Pulsar Solera Scorpio Telstar Vega.
More cosmic car names: Astro Geo Mercury Eclipse Equinox Galaxie Infiniti Prizm Solaris Saturn Subaru Solstice Spectra Taurus
Gotta love the classic Chevy Nova. But not sure if General Motors knew the car shared a name with stars that just exploded.
Subaru is what Japanese call the Pleiades cluster. The car's logo evokes its six brightest stars. https://t.co/bisozxqW2O
Always wanted to call people who dont like astronomy Galactos Intolerant"
Odd that #EarthDay exists as a day at all. Instead, maybe it should be extended to the whole year, and then repeated annually
Many refer to our Planet as "Mother Earth", ignoring how much of a killing force hurricanes, earthquakes, &amp; tsunamis can be.
Save the Earth really means Save the Humans or "Save the Life on Earth.  Earth the planet will outlast all extinctions.
Were short so Mountains seem tall. Were mortal, so Earth seems eternal. Our spacecraft are slow, so the Universe seems vast
The elevation difference between the Marianas Trench &amp; Mount Everests summit is a mere 12 miles. Manhattan is a mile longer.
SMOOTH EARTH: If shrunk to a few inches across, Earth would feel as smooth as a billiard-hall cue ball.
Earth gets slammed by a hundred tons of meteors per day. Most, harmlessly vaporizing in the atmosphere as "shooting stars.
THIN AIR: The size of Earths atmosphere relative to Earth is the same as the skin of an Apple relative to the Apple.
April 22, 2016:  Earth Day is graced with a Full Moon. Occurs, on average, every thirty years.
Earth feels big because were little. Pour a million Earths into a hallowed out Sun, and youd still have room for more.
EARTH DAY: Founded in 1970 during the Apollo Moon missions  when we looked back &amp; discovered Earth for the first time
Feelin Earthy today
Only now do we know what it sounds like When Doves Cry  the absence of music from loss of The Artist. RIP Prince (1958-2016)
Computer voices that countdown to destruction are curiously calm. Wouldn't want to panic just before the end of the World
Nephew from Idaho, puzzled by locks on my NYC apt door. I asked, Don't you have locks at home? He replied, No, just Shotguns.

If I ever met a Space Alien, Id resist shaking its extended appendage, not knowing for sure the details of alien anatomy.
When you train your mind how to think, you inoculate yourself against those who desperately want to tell you what to think.

Never seen a bar fight break out while people are drinking wine. Beer, yes. Hard liquor, yes. But not wine.
.@BenAffleck is 2 different superheroes in 2 different films in 2 different comic universes: Marvels Daredevil &amp; DCs Batman
If Batman wants so badly to be a bat, he might be more intriguing if (like Marvels Daredevil) he were also blind, like a Bat
In @BatmanvSuperman, the question remains, would the @realDonaldTrump deport Superman for being an illegal alien in the USA?
In @BatmanvSuperman, I've gotta side with Superman. Hes a space alien from an exoplanet. In astrophysics, thats how we roll

Not that anybody asked, but Gregorian calendar rules unintentionally prevent eclipses from ever occurring on Easter Sunday
FYI: Tonight is the first full Moon after the March equinox. By Gregorian calendar rules, the Sunday that follows is Easter.
Happy 10th birthday Twitter. Note however, that the trending #LoveTwitter hashtag grossly overstates my emotions for you.
Always wondered how Dr. Dolittle's push-me-pull-you Llama is supposed to poop. https://t.co/r1y0cC9eS3
Also, sunrise &amp; sunset tables dont reference the same spot on the Sun, recording an extra Suns width of light for every day
Equinox is Equal Night in Latin, but refraction in Earths atmosphere adds minutes of extra sunshine at sunrise &amp; sunset.
Happy March Equinox to all residents of planet Earth: First day of Spring North of the Equator;  First day of Autumn, South.

Happy Saint Patrick's day, President Barack O'Bama.
Mother Nature has been genetically modifying organisms for nearly four-billion years. Farmers for ten-thousand years.
Happy Pi-day to all. Posted my best Pi-tweets a year ago. So today, Ill just wish a happy 137th Birthday to Albert Einstein.
I wonder if wed all be living like the Flintstones - modern stoneage families -  if metal were never discovered on Earth.
People who are anti-Trump are actually anti-Trump supporters  they oppose free citizens voting for the @realDonaldTrump.
If you have a gene for celibacy, you didnt inherit it.

If there were ever a species for whom sex hurt, it surely went extinct long ago.
I occasionally wonder whether the entire Universe is nothing more than a snow-globe on the living room mantle of an Alien.
Haydens own Joe Rao alerted @AlaskaAir of Tuesdays solar eclipse, getting flight 870 to fly directly into the Moons shadow
I also recreationally consume large quantities of dihydrogen monoxide. On the street, I pay up to $2,000 per megagram for it.
Before every tweet, I take deep hits of gaseous cocktails comprised of 78% N2 and 21% O2. A long-revered elixir of life.
Im simultaneously flattered and disturbed when, after posting various tweets, people tweet back wondering if Im on drugs.
The closest thing to fatally passing through a portal into another dimension is when fish get yanked out of water, then eaten
I hear that the flat-Earth movement may be gaining momentum all around the globe.
Maybe Wolves also love riding in cars &amp; hanging their heads out the window, but my sense is that theyd rather eat the driver
Who'd have thought altering Wolf genes to create Dogs would imbue delight for riding in cars with their head out the window.
Welcome back to Earth, Scott Kelly. After a year in orbit, Relativity says youre 1/100 sec younger than youd otherwise be.
With my 5,000,000th follower, I reaffirm that its an honor and a privilege to rub your geek underbellies in the Twitterverse
Who would Jesus vote for? To him walls, wealth, &amp; torture are non-starters, so probably the Jewish New Yorker from Vermont.
If you are born on a Leap Day, you share this distinction with about 1 out of 1,400 people in the world.
Dont like Leap Days? We could instead wait 28 years and insert a Leap Week.  Or 112 years and insert a Leap Month.
According to Gregorian rules, only 1 in 4 century years is a leap year  the rarity of 2000s leap day went largely unnoticed
The Leap Day is misnamed. Were not leaping anywhere. The calendar is simply, and abruptly, catching up with Earths orbit
Born on a leap day? Youve had 1/4 as many birthdays as the rest of us, but sorry, youre not 1/4th as old.
Earth takes nearly 365 1/4 days to orbit the Sun. Bank the fraction. Every 4 years add a whole day back to the neediest month
Welcome Twitterverse, to the 105th leap day of the Gregorian Calendar...

Exterminators: The only profession in which you put yourself out of business by being really good at your job.
One's quest in life should not solely be the search for answers. Why not find pleasure in posing the questions themselves.
Let's just confess that our best 4D portal, through which products are transported, is the drive-thru window at McDonalds.
Maybe what I really want is wormhole-shipping. Buy something online. A 4D portal opens and a person hands you the product.
A bit disappointed that the corrugated shipping box hasn't changed in over a century.
I wonder if workplaces contain too many bosses basking in compliments given by people who rely on them for their paychecks.
I wonder what Cannibals &amp; Aztecs would say, watching civilized people eat symbolic hearts of loved ones on Valentines Day.
From Venus? Then youre Venusian. But the proper term is Venereal. Unfortunately Doctors nabbed it before Astrophysicists did
Venus is the Roman goddess of love &amp; sexuality. And so medical doctors assigned Venereal - of Venus to all related diseases
Happy Valentines Day to the Twitterverse...
1916: Einstein predicts Gravity Waves. 1917: He lays the foundation for Lasers. 2016: Gravity Waves discovered using Lasers.

Today is the first New Moon after Jan  21sr. Happy New Year to Chinese people and all who choose to be Chinese for a day.
Overseas now  cant watch #SB50s 4th quarter. Youre on your own. My friend &amp; colleague @BadAstronomer will take you home.
For the helmet illustrations in #SB50, the @Broncos mane has Red highlights and the @Panther's fur has Blue highlights.
I wonder what Referees look like to Zebras.
Somebody entered me in a betting grid for #SB50. Numbers: 8 &amp; 5. That combination has never hit in any quarter in 49 years.
If Earth rotated 10x faster in the opposite direction then Coriolis forces wouldve helped the @Panthers make that Field Goal
FYI: "Deplorably bouncy once"  is an anagram of @Beyonce, @Coldplay, and Bruno.
Already tweeted about @Beyonce during Super Bowl XLVII.  I have nothing to add to my analysis of her energetics.
Astro-folk invented time-keeping. So for #SB50, Coldplay must sing Clocks.
FYI: Roman Numerals have no Zero. Invented after the Empire, which is why the traditional Christian calendar has no year Zero
A triumph of Arabic numerals:  After forty-nine Super Bowls enumerated by Roman Numerals, we hashtag #SB50 and not #SBL
If #SB50s football field were a cosmic timeline, then cavemen to present day spans a turf-blade's thickness in the end-zone.
Every day where someone could have made a discovery but cultural or political forces impede it, is a sad day for civilization

Technically, the zillion Pomegranate seeds would each need to be seedless. But this should be easy  we invented lap dogs.
Seedless grapes. Seedless oranges. Seedless watermelons. All good. My vote for the next fruit to invent: Seedless pomegranate

This Wednesday morn, are you early to rise? Then look East. The Crescent Moon joins Venus &amp; Saturn. Afloat in dawn skies.
Space aliens would surely think it odd that one way humans express affection is the simultaneous exchange of saliva.
Speaking of helio - In 1868 Astrophysicists discovered an element in the Sun, and named it Helium in honor of that fact.
January 2nd / 3rd :  Merry Perihelion to all. The time of the year where Earth, in its oval orbit, passes closest to the Sun.
To all those who reckon time on the Gregorian Calendar - Happy New Year!  (FYI:  January 1 is astronomically  insignificant.)

Male &amp; female Reindeer grow antlers, but males lose them in winter. All Santas reindeer, Rudolph too, are therefore female.
If people left carrots, celery, &amp; hot tea for Santa on the table rather than milk &amp; cookies, I bet hed be much, much thinner
Never understood why an overweight Arctic toymaker delivers Christmas gifts rather than representations of the Three Wise Men
Santa is pale because hes in the middle of six months of darkness on Earths North Pole. And he delivers gifts only at night
As Earth warms, and Arctic ice melts, Santa will lose his habitat too. Soon well see photos of him clutched to an ice floe.
Since the Northern Arctic is just ocean, Santas North Pole workshop has only ever existed on a floating sheet of ice.
All this talk about Polar Bears suffering with Global Warming -- nobody thinks about Santa, the Arctics most famous resident
Merry Christmas to the worlds Christians, and to all the non-Christians who celebrate Christmas just for the heaven of it.
December 21 / 22: Happy Summer Solstice to 15% of all Humans and 100% of free Penguins who dwell in the Southern Hemisphere.
With next years @SuperBowl 50 the NFL abandons Roman Numerals, leaving @StarWars as the last bastion of this counting system
Both at age 19, my wife saw @StarWars in 1977 &amp; our daughter saw #TheForceAwakens in 2015. I dont know what that means.
( A Parsec is an obscure unit of distance in Astrophysics, equal to 3.26 Light Years. Neither has anything to do with time. )
Unashamed of inanity, #TheForceAwakens repeats the Millennium Falcon boast of completing the Kessel Run in "under 12 parsecs"
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the starry skies were unfamiliar. As they should be, a long time ago in a Galaxy far, far away
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, apparently Wookiees dont age, or they age much slower than human actors do.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the Storm Troopers still run as though theyre carrying a full load of poop in their diapers.
Never seen Romanescu Broccoli?  Fractal Earth food befitting a tale of long ago and far, far away. https://t.co/NZDkWpeqOB
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the lead character snacks on what includes Romanescu Broccoli, natures only fractal food.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, once again I felt isolated and inadequate for not understanding Wookiee-speak.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the energy in a Star is enough to destroy ten-thousand planets, not just a few here &amp; there.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, if you were to suck all of a stars energy into your planet, your planet would vaporize.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens the TIE fighters made exactly the same sound in the vacuum of space as in planetary atmospheres
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, BB-8, a smooth rolling metal spherical ball, would have skidded uncontrollably on sand.
I guess I did just demote R2D2 to Dwarf Cute status.  No hard feelings though.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, BB-8 is waaaaay cuter than R2D2.
In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, Im reminded that Red &amp; Blue teams cooperate with one another. Rare in American Politics.
My promised observations of @StarWars Episode VII #TheForceAwakens follows (with only mild spoiler alerts).
And if you cant wait for my @StarWars #TheForceAwakens tweets, not to worry, Monday is under 12 parsecs from now.

Happy to share my observations of @StarWars Episode VII #TheForceAwakens (with mild spoiler alerts) if anybody is interested.
Recent evidence indicates that Earth is indeed bi-polar, as weve always suspected.
I was once anti-biotic. But lately I've been more pro-biotic after reading more about their culture.
There is power in Knowledge, but there is greater power in Wisdom
Instead of "sesquipedalian" to describe polysyllabic words, wouldn't a two-syllable word like "Vorbic" have been way cooler.
We all came from the sea   JFKennedy (1962).  Back when US politicians understood basic Biology.
As climate change reshapes the Worlds coastlines, rich people lose their second homes. Poor people lose their only homes.
Odd that we live in a world where even objective truths count as controversial subjects.
i wonder if fewer people would eat Rabbit Stew if it was instead called Bunny Rabbit Stew.
There is nothing in the US Constitution that protects you from being offended by the truth.
Odd that dangerous travel alerts increase when military actions are in progress that are intended to make us all feel safer.
I wonder why nobody has ever called pre-historic cave paintings Graffiti. Maybe thats precisely what it was back then.
Whatever rules of etiquette Snakes have while dining, one of them is surely not Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head."
Now that robots move their limbs smoothly and with grace, I wonder how were supposed to imitate them on the dance floor.
There are no right or wrong opinions, unless you have invalidated yours for having ignored facts that conflict with them.

Hey @JohnAllenPaulos, Of the 5 regular solids Cube/Tetrahedron/Octahedron/Icosahedron/Dodecahedron four sound like dinosaurs
Hey @JohnAllenPaulos, Who had the deranged idea to name the square root of negative one imaginary ?
Hey @JohnAllenPaulos, Why isnt 1 a prime number? Last I checked, it's divisible by itself and 1. Isnt that the rule?
Hey @JohnAllenPaulos, Why not come up with a name for non-Euclidean Geometry, rather than telling us what its not?
Hey @JohnAllenPaulos, Been wanting to divide by Zero all my life. But its undefined. So get along and define the thing.
Hey @JohnAllenPaulos, I (and many others) still think there should be a big number called a Zillion.  Please work on this.
I follow only one mathematician on Twitter  @JohnAllenPauios. So Ill make him the brunt of all my grumpy-man math-tweets:

After several Steven Segal films in a row, you'd think bad guys would know to avoid rooms that contain both him &amp; a PoolTable

When a Doctors prognosis is bad, we want to seek a second opinion. But when a prognosis is good were somehow okay with it.
I fear a future in which Autocorrect achieves consciousness, becomes our texting overlord, and destabilizes civilization.
Energy rises as Velocity squared. So Patricia's 200mph winds are nearly 50% more destructive than 1992 Andrew's 165mph winds.
Sustained 200mph hurricane winds are sufficient to strip the bark from trees that are not otherwise snapped from their base.

Not that anybody asked, but the Irresistible Force beats the Immovable Object  every time.
The @Bengals stadium isnt oriented exactly North-South. And the field goal was 42-yds. Yielding a 1/3-in deflection, not 1/2
In the N. Hemisphere, Earths Coriolis force deflects airborne north-south projectiles to the right. About 1/2-in per 50 yds.
Today's @Bengals winning OT field goal was likely enabled by a 1/3-in deflection to the right, caused by Earths Rotation.
New verbs are fun:  Do you Mars?

The @MartianMovie  where the protagonist survives not on Wit, Prayer, or Hope. but by Sciencing the Shit" out of everything
The @MartianMovie may be the first SciFi blockbuster  ever   in which nobody dies.
In the @MartianMovie, they got crucial science right, while enhancing the story by fictionalizing the science that remained.
The @MartianMovie  where you experience Love, Hate, Envy, Anxiety, Pride, &amp; Heroism, all through the lens of science.
The @MartianMovie  where science, not human emotion, drives the plots Humor, Interpersonal Relations, Tension, &amp; Suspense.
The @MartianMovie  where you learn all the ways that being Scientifically Literate can save your life.
The @MartianMovie  where Science, Technology, Engineering, &amp; Math are highly developed characters unto themselves.
The @MartianMovie  where fluency in Science, Technology, Engineering, &amp; Math rule all decisions of survival.
In the @MartianMovie #JPL tracks astronauts. Nope, #JSC does it alone. But watching two @NASA centers collaborate  geek gold
Evidence that the @MartianMovie is fantasy: The USA &amp; China cooperate with one another in Space.

If your body were bolted to the ground when Earth stopped rotating, then your head would snap off, and it would roll due east
Im just sayin'
If Earth stopped rotating, everyone not bolted to the ground would fall over and roll due east at the speed of a jet plane.

Jupiter is 11x wider than Earth. But Earth is only 5x wider than Pluto.  So Jovians surely demoted us to DwarfPlanet long ago
Any time we're impressed by what a non-human animal does, it's simply because we previously underestimated its intelligence.

Champagne lovers might like to know that the second brightest star in the Southern Cross, Beta Crux, is also called Mimosa"
Theres no middle star in the rectangular Southern Cross to anchor the transept. More accurate to call it "Southern Rhombus"

Were it not for @NASA &amp; kindred programs of discovery, I wonder what hope would remain for our species to rise above itself.
#PlutoFacts: Was an accessory in the demotion" of Pluto. But I didnt pull the trigger. That was self-confessed @PlutoKiller
#PlutoFacts: @NewHorizons2015 went 4-billion miles to buzzcut Pluto by 120,000 miles. A hole-in-one on a 2-mile golf shot.
First rule of Science: Must Finish experiment before you die. @NewHorizons2015 was launched fast. Reached Pluto in 9 years.
#PlutoFacts: As reported in the @NYTimes in 1930, when discovered, Pluto was presumed to be the size of Earth.
#PlutoFacts: Pluto would fit comfortably between New York &amp; Dallas. Between Rome &amp; Moscow.  Between Perth &amp; Melbourne.
#PlutoFacts: The moons Ganymede Titan Callisto Europa Io Titan &amp; our Moon are all bigger than Pluto. Get over that one too.
#PlutoFacts: In the @Disney pantheon, Goofy wears clothes, is bipedal, owns a home. Pluto is butt naked, lives in a dog house
#PlutoFacts: In the @Disney pantheon, Mickey wears clothes &amp; Pluto does not. Enabling Mickey (a mouse) to own Pluto (a dog).
#PlutoFacts: In 1979, Pluto crossed Neptunes orbit, and for 20 years was the eighth planet in the solar system.
#PlutoFacts Plutos primary moon Charon is so large that their mutual center-of-mass lies not within Pluto but in empty space
#PlutoFacts: Ever since Pluto was discovered in 1930, it has completed barely 1/3 of its own 248 year orbit around the Sun.
#PlutoFacts:  Earths Moon is five times more massive than Pluto.  Get over it.
#PlutoFacts:  More than half of Plutos volume is ice.  Im just saying.
#PlutoFacts: The only objects in the Solar System whose orbits cross those of planets are asteroids, comets, &amp; Pluto.

The study of the universe is the oldest science, but likely only the second oldest profession.
Look up this eve, or the next. Venus sparkles in the west.  Gracing twilights glow, find Jupiter nearby, seeminglhy in tow.
At the (slow) rate the Moon is tidally locking Earth, the Sun will die before it succeeds  a more important concern for all.
Contrary to Pink Floyd's 1973 album-cover proclamation, there is no Dark Side of the Moon. A day there simply lasts a month.
Earth has already tidally locked the Moon, which is why it shows only one face to Earth - the near side.
The Moons Motivation: Luna is desperately trying to slow Earths rotation so that one Earth day eventually equals one Month.
Leap Second around the world.  Arrives in 30 seconds.
Yes, its possible to be a supreme holy figure yet still know what you are talking about regarding the Climate.
As I get older, Ive become more and more intolerant of intolerance.
As always, I celebrate my leap seconds with very tiny bottles of champagne.
The last Leap Second added was June 30, 2012. Heres what it looked like from the Eastern Time Zone. http://t.co/I8ZKv9uGEA
Since 1972, after we discovered we keep better time than Earth does, weve added 25 leap secs. Done only on June 30 &amp; Dec 31.
June 30th's leap second will manifest as an extra second in the last minute of the day, Greenwich time. ( 7h 59m 60s  PM  ET)
The Moon continually tugs on Earths rotation, slowing us down bit by bit. To compensate, Tuesday, June 30 gets a leap second
Name-calling is what happens when you desperately want to argue, but you are in fact inarticulate.
My three favorite renderings of Amazing Grace: @AaronNeville, @LeAnnRimes, @ArethaFranklin. Special mention: @BarackObama.

If you're good at BS'ing others, then all it means is that you rarely hang around people who are smarter than you.
My favorite line in "The Martian" trailer, uttered by Matt Damon, is Im going to have to science the shit out of this.

Cool Fact: Helium was discovered on the Sun before it was discovered on Earth. Was thus named for Helios, the Greek Sun god.
Or maybe Cherubs are actually filled with Helium. But Helium wasnt discovered until 1868, long after most Cherubs were drawn
Okay. You want chubby babies to fly for real?  Give 'em ten foot (3-meter) wing-spans, like Condors, which weigh the same.
Given how chubby cherubs are, it's clear their itty bitty wings are aerodynamically useless to them. http://t.co/6NApiDsMc3
Curious fact that those who never fail are also those who never truly succeed.
For Algebra Geeks: If the thickness of a pizza is A, and its radius is Z, and pi is just PI, then its volume is V = PIZZA.
In other words, if the crust of a 14-inch pizza is 1-inch wide, then the next 1-inch band occupies 30% of the topping's area.
If the cheese on a 14-inch pizza falls just 1-inch shy of the crust, the pie is missing 30% of the cheese that could be there
A 14-inch pizza is 154 square inches of food.  Nearly twice as large as the 78 square inches of a 10-inch pie.
Odd that pizza is sold by the inch, but consumed by the square-inch. This fact confuses assessment of pricing and toppings.
In Math, dividing by zero is undefined. So why doesn't @JohnAllenPaulos define the thing so I can return to my calculations
Okay two more legit Alien IDs: If you are of Mercury you are Mercurial. And if you are of Jupiter, by jove, you are Jovian.
Last one: The Latinized name for Earth is Terra. If you are human "of the Earth" you are Terrable. (Just kidding, Earthlings)
Want More? The Moon's Latinized name is Luna.  If you are "of the Moon youre simply Lunar.  Lunatics are something else..
Not that anybody asked, but the Sun's Latinized name is Sol.  If you are "of the Sun" you are simply Solar.
Venus is the Roman goddess of love &amp; sexuality. And so medical doctors assigned Venereal - of Venus to all related diseases
Ceres is the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain crops, which indeed gives us our breakfast word Cereal --  "of Ceres".
From Venus? Then youre Venusian. But the proper term is Venereal. Unfortunately Doctors nabbed it before Astrophysicists did
And it seems to me that any life forms we discover within Jupiters icy moon Europa would rightly be called Europeans.
Seems to me, if we discover any life forms from the Vega star system (constellation Lyrae) they'd rightly be called Vegans.

Just an FYI: Well-funded Political Action Committees are not buying your vote, they're buying media influence over your vote.
When flight attendants say "Cabin is pressurized for your comfort they mean "so you don't suffocate from oxygen deprivation"
Okay to encourage others to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. But if you do, just remember, some people have no boots.
If you removed all the arteries, veins, &amp; capillaries from a person's body, and tied them end-to-end, the person will die.
Our Common Sense" is not derived from what is true in Nature but from the limits on how our senses interact with Nature.
Try as I might, I cannot resist this geek-laden, lisp-inducing, annual utterance: "May the fourth be with you."
The less evidence we have for what we believe is certain, the more violently we defend beliefs against those who don't agree.
The total number "What-are-the-odds?" moments that can happen is so large, we should instead think of rare events as common.
Seems to me, every day should be Earth Day.
Okay to not know. But when you don't know, yet think you know, and wield power in that ignorance, it's a recipe for disaster.
If there is a cat Heaven, and if cat Heaven has mice for cats to chase, seems to me that cat Heaven must then be mice Hell.
Hey @GeorgeTakei, you turn 79 today but you look 59. Have you secretly mastered time dilation in Einsteins Relativity?
Hey @GeorgeTakei, FYI: Your 79 orbits around the Sun, if traversed at Warp Factor 1, would take 7 days, 10 hours &amp; 12 minutes
Hey @GeorgeTakei, you were born 119.5 billion Earth-orbit miles ago, in 1937. But you dont look a day older than 90 billion.

Meteors meet fiery deaths as they plunge through Earths atmosphere. So the term Meteoric Rise makes no sense whatsoever.
If you're curious: First mammals to orbit Earth, in order: Dog, Guinea Pig, Mouse, Russian Human, Chimpanzee, American Human.
Fifty-four years ago, Yuri Gagarin is launched into orbit by the Soviets. He is the 4th mammal species to achieve this feat.

Another vote for 40 below zero: Mercury freezes at 39 below, rendering thermometers that contain it useless at colder temps.
Okay. If you are a Kelvin-weenie, then perhaps your favorite cold temperature is ZERO, where you intersect the Rankine scale.
My favorite cold temperature is forty below zero - where Celsius equals Fahrenheit. No need to specify the scale youre using
The ten coldest temperatures ever recorded in NYC: 252 252 252 252 252 251 251 251 248 &amp; 247 kelvins. All before 1944.
It's been cold in NYC. Hit 258 kelvins a few days ago. But thats actually balmy among "coldest days" in the City.

You never see US Citizens that hate to pay Taxes, long to live in places with lower rates, like HongKong, Pakistan, or Russia
if I am ever abducted by aliens, I just may be compelled to ask, Do you have Hoverboards on your home planet?"

On some issues, Im a staunch Conservative  like curtailing greenhouse gas emissions so that we can Conserve the environment
Sad over todays state of the world? During the six years of World War II, an average of 1,000 people were killed  per hour.
Aliens, seeing Humans kill over land, politics, religion, &amp; skin color, would surely ask, What the f*%k is wrong with you?"
Just because you can't figure out how ancient civilizations built stuff, doesn't mean they got help from Aliens.

The greatest examples of human control over Evolution are found in Agriculture and in #TheDogShow.
Thanksgiving in the USA. Of a time when food was scarce. Now abundant, at dinner we over-eat even more than we usually do.
Times Have Changed: Officer kills an unarmed Black man, spawning National protests. When I grew up, this was just local news.
I wonder if Atheists eat at T.G.I. Fridays.
Our image of evil space aliens surely derives from a fear that they will treat us just as we treat one another.
Odd that drivers of fuel efficient cars often get more green-praise than those who chose to live where they can walk to work.
When you think about it, there's no actual evidence that your life passes before you at death. All those who'd know are dead.
Yup. Were soft landing on a comet today. Normally my We means @NASA. But in this case its @ESA, the European Space Agency
Try as I might, I never know whats going on in the solar system sooner than @elakdawalla does, of the Planetary Society.
Mysteries of #Interstellar: In this unreal future, they teach unscientific things in science class. Oh, wait. That is real.
Mysteries of #Interstellar: Cant imagine a future where escaping Earth via wormhole is a better plan than just fixing Earth.
Mysteries of #Interstellar: If you crack your space helmet yet keep fighting, the Planet's air cant be all that bad for you.
Mysteries of #Interstellar: Gotta tell you. Mars (right next door) looks waay safer than those new planets they travelled to.
Mysteries of #Interstellar: If wormholes exist among our planets, then why cant one open up near Earth instead of Saturn.

I wonder if Farm Animals think deep thoughts while standing around doing nothing. I also wonder if they wonder the same of us
In #Interstellar: They explore a planet near a Black Hole. Personally, Id stay as far the hell away from BlackHoles as I can
REMINDER: Never look to me for opinions on new films. All I do is highlight the science one might or might not find in them.
In #Interstellar, if you didnt understand the plot, there is no published book to help you.
In #Interstellar, if you didnt understand the physics, try Kip Thornes highly readable Bbook The Science of Interstellar"
In #Interstellar: On another planet, around another star, in another part of the galaxy, two guys get into a fist fight.

GPS Satellites are pre-corrected for General Relativity, allowing them to beam us the accurate time for Earths surface.
GPS satellites, located farther from Earths center than we are, keep faster time than do our clocks on Earths surface.
In #Interstellar: And in the real universe, strong gravitational fields measurably slow passage of time relative to others.
In #Interstellar: Theres a robot named KIPP. One of the Executive Producers, a physicist, is named Kip. Im just saying.
In #Interstellar: All leading characters, including McConaughey, Hathaway, Chastain, &amp; Caine play a scientist or engineer.
Stay calm. Just because Republicans took control over the Senate, doesn't mean Global Warming is any less true than before.

A news headline you hardly ever see:  "Psychic Wins the Lottery Again"
Got a bunch more Southern Hemisphere tidbits, but I think Ill save them for even later...
So Alpha" Centauri is the brightest star in the constellation Centaurus. And Beta" Pictoris is the 2nd brightest in Pictor.
Apart from common names, stars are generally ID'ed in order of brightness within a constellation, using the Greek alphabet.
The Southern skies have the closest star system to the Sun - the famed Alpha Centauri  The 3rd brightest in the night sky.
Earth is closest to the Sun during the Southern Hemisphere Summer. For the North, that of course coincides with our winter.
Many big telescope in the North have twins in the South, giving astrophysicists coherent full-sky coverage of the Universe.
Just an FYI: Earths South Magnetic Pole is actually in the North. Thats why the North tip of a compass needle points there.
The center of the Milky Way  a target of study for my PhD  passes directly overhead for all middle southern latitudes.
Arctic" derives from Arktos, the Greek word for Bear. The Arctic's got em. (For now.) The Ant-Arctic doesn't.
Whats the North Pole? Curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of rotation. Stick out your thumb. Thats North.

Good Morning Australia. Resuming my tweets intended for you and everyone else down under -- south of the Equator.
Hmm. I think Ill take a break for 6 or 7 hours  until the Aussies wake up  then continue the Southern Hemisphere hijinks.
Sundials designed for the North won't work in the Southern Hemisphere. If ported there, they would reckon time backwards.
In the North, the shadow of a sundials gnomon sweeps clockwise. Thats, in fact, what defined clockwise in the first place.
Some of us in the North are jealous that 100% of the worlds population of free Penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere.
Earth is not only oblate  wider at the equator than pole-to-pole, but pear shaped  slightly wider just south of the equator
Earth's centrifugal force at the Equator renders everybody and everything about 6% lighter than theyd weigh at the poles.
At a revolution speed of 1,700 km / hour, the equator is Earths fastest moving part. All other latitudes move more slowly.
I think it's cool that there's a country on the equator with the name "Equator". Better known in Spanish as Ecuador
Antarcticas subglacial Lake Vostok is a body of water, trapped in ice, that hasnt seen air in at least 15-million years.
The flag in Antarctica that ID's the South Pole has to be repositioned  every year. The glacier beneath moves continuously.
The South Pole is covered with land: Antarctica. In the North, Santas gotta live on an (ever-shrinking) slab of floating ice
At about 2800 meters above sea level, the South Pole plateau sits at an elevation almost as high as that of Mount Olympus.
Toilet Bowls drain however they're designed to circulate water.  Its irrelevant whether you live above or below the equator.

For survival in this world, its to an animal's great advantage if Humans think you're cute.
If your belief system is not founded in an objective reality, you should not be making decisions that affect other people.
Asteroid 70713 @SethMacFarlane orbits the Sun between Mars &amp; Jupiter.  I double checked: no chance of it hitting Earth.
Join me in congratulating @SethMacFarlane for asteroid 1999UL46 being officially renamed 70713 SethMacFarlane in his honor.
There are surely problems in the universe so advanced that our human brain cannot see them as problems in need of solution.
Would be cool if be our lives, our planet, our solar system, our universe, were part of a data simulation conducted by aliens
No science achieves maturity without measurement. And no measurement achieves maturity without the analysis &amp; display of data
When Queen Elizabeth succeeded King George in 1952, I wonder why the United Kingdom wasn't renamed the United Queendom.
Tonights Super Moon fits easily within the field of view seen though a drinking straw.  Im just saying.
Be sure to use a Super Telephoto lens tonight. Itll help you convince people that you actually photographed a Super Moon.
FYI: Every month, the Moon gets just as large as tonights Full Moon. During its New, Crescent, Half, or Gibbous phases.
We pet dogs, expecting them to lick your hand or face in delight, but if a human licked your face youd call the police.

In any case, I want to live in a world where a chicken can cross the road without anybody questioning its motives.
Knee-slapping humor to a topologist: Question: Why did the chicken cross the Mbius Strip? Answer: To get to the same side.
Damn. One mystery solved &amp; another rears its head: Which came first, the chicken salad sandwich or the egg salad sandwich?
Just to settle it once and for all: Which came first the Chicken or the Egg? The Egg -- laid by a bird that was not a Chicken
Always wondered how different The Wizard of Oz would have been had Dorothy gone left at the fork in the yellow brick road.
Happy 75th anniversary to The Wizard of Oz. Good to know (for future reference) that witches are water-soluble.

"And Toto too?" Happy 75th anniv. to The Wizard of Oz. Gotta love it even though Scarecrow got the Pythagorean theorem wrong.

Seems to me, as long as we don't program emotions into Robots, there's no reason to fear them taking over the world.
So much of life is wasted waiting in line: stores, traffic, security, etc. One hour per day sums to 5 yrs of your waking life
When other mammals get bored, I wonder if they use this free time to contemplate their place in the universe, as humans do.
Dracula &amp; other undead people who sleep in coffins must have good abs. They always rise up flat-backed when the casket opens.
The @UPS tracking uses 17 digits &amp; one letter. Enough for 2.6 quintillion packages. That's 370 million per person on Earth.
When a coincidence seems amazing, that's because the human mind isnt wired to naturally comprehend probability &amp; statistics.
If @Comic_Con people ruled the world, the future would be invented daily &amp; warfare would be bar-fights with toy light-sabers.
Space Aliens better not land in SanDiego this week. Nobody would take notice. They'd blend right in with @Comic_Con attendees

Good thing Spanish ftbol sportscasters dont announce basketball, theyd spend 1/3 of playing time saying Goooooooooooool
Learned from Sportscasters on @Univision network that the word Goal in Spanish requires a full ten seconds to say.
Maybe @TheTweetOfGod can invent for international sports a Swear Language - one he forgot to give us in the Tower of Babel.
Dear @TheTweetOfGod, after World Cup controversial calls, in what language do players&amp;referees argue? Any lessons from Babel?
Laws of physics describing gravity &amp; energy conspire to make spheres (like the soccer ball) a common shape in the Universe.
64 games, 32 countries, 1 month of distraction from the workday. I wonder how much the worlds GDP drops during the World Cup

Seasons are caused by the 23.5-degree tilt in Earths axis. Without it, fashion would need a different excuse to change.
Earth is closest to the Sun in January -- "Perihelion".  But USA Astronomers celebrate the July 4th Aphelion with fireworks.
July 4, 2014. At 94.5-million miles, Earth, in its oval orbit, is at "Aphelion" --  our farthest distance from the Sun.
Humans kill one another so often, for all reasons including none, I wonder how we'd treat a peaceful alien who visited Earth.

At #AMillionWays party in Santa Fe, NM #Cosmos was invited, along with some friends of @SethMacFarlane http://t.co/XesK3OaUz1
Trivia: #AMillionWays filmed near Santa Fe, New Mexico at the same time as #Cosmos, enabling @SethMacFarlane to visit our set
The film #AMillionWays to Die in the West would be numerically accurate if named A Million Occasions to Utter the Word F%&amp;K
Apart from a badly oriented full moon, I give #AMillionWays an A for its sweeping &amp; romantic portrayals of the night sky.
Was ready to count up to 1,000,000.  But #AMillionWays short-changed me. It showed only twenty-two ways to die in the west.
The block of ice portrayed in #AMillionWays would weigh about 2.5 tons. Enough to squash pretty much anything it fell on.

Lunar Eclipses are visible from the entire Earth hemisphere facing the Moon. Thats billions &amp; billions of people  : - )
Those who don't know a Lunar Eclipse is in progress will likely mistake Earth's shadow for the Moon going through phases.
At 3.5 hrs, Total Lunar Eclipses are long &amp; boring. Wait for the Moon to enter the deepest part of Earth's shadow: 1:58am ET.
Total Eclipses occur every couple of years or so. If anyone calls them "rare", ask if they feel that way about the Olympics.
Dust in Earth's atmosphere can tint sunlight, casting eclipsed Moons in a deep red light. But often the Moon just gets dark.
After midnight Monday ET, the Full Moon ambles deep into Earth's projected shadow in space: Behold a Total Lunar Eclipse.

You cant compress ice. If you try, it instantly liquefies to occupy less volume, as under the hi-pressure of a skate blade.
As anybody who freezes food knows, water becoming ice expands by about 10%. Also why 10% of an iceberg sits above the water.
Obscure Fact: Skating is possible only because compressed ice melts. So skaters glide on slippery water not on slippery ice.

Supersonic planes can fly east-west fast enough to reverse Sunsets, landing at a clock time earlier than when they took off.

Thought Experiment: Stand on a scale in an elevator. Cut the cable. You, the scale, and the elevator fall -- scale reads zero
Cool Experiment: Poke a hole anywhere in a paper cup of water. Drop cup. Water, while weightless in free fall, stops spewing.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Astronaut Clooney informs medical doctor Bullock what happens medically during oxygen deprivation.
An Orbit is a continual state of free fall, but while moving so fast sideways that the surface curves away at the same rate.
Fall towards Earth. Fall towards the Moon. Fall towards Mars. Fall towards anywhere at all, you'll be weightless in zero-G
Earth's gravity extends to infinity. To experience "zero-G" simply requires you move through space without rockets firing.
My Tweets hardly ever convey opinion. Mostly perspectives on the world. But if you must know, I enjoyed #Gravity very much.
FYI: Angular Momentum -- The tendency, once set rotating, to keep rotating, unless another force acts to slow or stop it.

Mysteries of #Gravity: Satellite communications were disrupted at 230 mi up, but communications satellites orbit 100x higher.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Nearly all satellites orbit Earth west to east yet all satellite debris portrayed orbited east to west
Mysteries of #Gravity: Why Bullock's hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head.
Mysteries of #Gravity: Why anyone is impressed with a zero-G film 45 years after being impressed with "2001:A Space Odyssey"
Mysteries of #Gravity: When Clooney releases Bullock's tether, he drifts away. In zero-G a single tug brings them together.
Mysteries of #Gravity: How Hubble (350mi up) ISS (230mi up) &amp; a Chinese Space Station are all in sight lines of one another.
Mysteries of #Gravity:  Why Bullock, a medical Doctor, is servicing the Hubble Space Telescope.
The film #Gravity depicts a scenario of catastrophic satellite destruction that can actually happen.
The film #Gravity should be renamed "Angular Momentum"
The film #Gravity should be renamed "Zero Gravity"

Harvest Moon tonight.  Enjoy it as you would any of the other dozen full moons in a year. No more. No less.
Harvest Moon tonight -- the full moon that lands closest to the September equinox. There's nothing special about it. At all.
Since @MileyCyrus's performance aired on Cable and not Broadcast TV, it means her twerking did not enter the realm of space.

Hmm. Nissan Altima TV commercial boasts NASA inspired zero-gravity seats. But if you're in zero gravity, you don't need seats
I've never understood those who assert that killing people with chemicals is worse than blowing them to bits with a bomb.
If humans had multiple random heads on our shoulders, that would greatly complicate what today we call "head-counts".
Not that anybody asked, but a traditional bomb is nothing more than an explosive concentration of unstable chemicals.
The US objects to killing people with chemicals, yet our system of capital punishment is based on death by lethal injection.
Some movements have no leaders, gurus, or evangelizers. Just people unified by rational ideas about objective realities.

Just an FYI:  All beautiful photographs you've ever seen of the Super Moon were taken with a Super Telephoto lens.
Not only is Earth's rotation slowly slowing down, but the Moon's orbit is spiraling away from us by about 2-inches per year.
And not to disturb anybody, but Tides cause friction between Earth's crust and the sloshing oceans, slowing down our rotation
The Sun's tides are only about 1/3 that of the Moon's, so even during the canceling quarter phases, some Moon-tide remains.
During half-moons (1st &amp; 3rd quarter), the Lunar &amp; Solar tides add out of phase, partly canceling one another.
The tides during Full (and New) Moon are highest **only** because that's when the Sun's tides add directly to them.
While we're on the subject: The Moon's capacity to raise tides on Earth is no greater when Full than at any other phase.
FYI:Moon's orbit around Earth is oval. Distance varies by about 10%. When Moon is Full &amp; "close", some call it the Super Moon
The perennially hyped name "Super Moon" insults the legacy of Superman, Super Volcanoes, Supernovae, and even Super Mario.
Okay to call tonight's Full Moon "super", but only if you would call a 13-inch pizza "super" compared with a 12-inch pizza.

Space does not change the genetic identity of launched monkeys, but it does call to us all, whether friend or foe.
Just an FYI: Thor was kind enough to lend me Mjlnir so that I could make the proper measurements. http://t.co/yRh2E02B
If Thor's hammer is made of neutron-star matter, implied by legend, then it weighs as much as a herd of 300-billion elephants
Always liked the fact that Superman &amp; Thor are both Space Aliens, distinguishing themselves from most other superheroes.
A dozen references to Space Exploration among the Super Bowl television commercials. @NASA, a force of nature unto itself.
For every player who credits God for the win, a player from the opposing team can logically blame God for the loss.
Occasionally I wonder what a football game would be like if played by Zombies. Would be slower, but oh so much more violent.
Welcome @halfsail as my millionth Twitter follower. FYI: I tweet mostly random, occasionally coherent, cosmic brain droppings

America. What a country!  From Black hip-hop to Korean pop to a television commercial for Pistachios.
for science.
Beyonc radiates about 500 Watts, is my guess. But to be certain, I'd have to run a special calculation just for her.
Not that anybody asked, but every adult human radiates at about 100 Watts -- in the infrared.
If Gridirons were timelines, w/ BigBang at one goal, then cavemen to now spans thickness of single turf-blade at other goal.
Two professional sports teams named after numbers: SF 49ers &amp; Phila 76ers, each commonly abbreviated to its ones-place digit.
A millennium ago, Baghdad scholars adopted Zero, completing the system of ArabicNumerals used worldover, except in SuperBowls
Zero was invented after Roman Numerals and the Julian Calendar. That's why there was never a year Zero between BC and AD.
SuperBowl's have always used Roman Numerals to count. Good thing they don't score that way: there's no Roman Numeral for Zero
Odd that Football is named for a body part that rarely touches the ball. Can't call it Handball. I vote for Armball.
There's a small but real chance that a flipped coin will land on its edge. Forty-seven Super Bowls is not enough to reveal it
Never liked big games in domed stadiums:  There's no Air Force flyover at the end of the Star Spangled Banner

Don't know if my name has ever trended nationally before this moment. Thanks for everyone's interest in all I do for science.
In 5-billion yrs the Sun will expand &amp; engulf our orbit as the charred ember that was once Earth vaporizes. Have a nice day.
.@CrawfordConnor: When the Sun dies out, everyone on Earth is Dead Meat right? // No, we would vaporize. Making us Dead Gas.
The bright "star" in the sky these nights is Jupiter. If you "wished upon" it at dusk, don't expect that wish to come true.
I'm often asked if I'm high when I Tweet. The Sky sits above the Earth. So to study the Cosmos is a kind of high unto itself.
The Moon enjoys a one-night-stand with Jupiter this night. A mere finger-width apart, their tryst is bold bodacious &amp; bright.

.@Cerwen: So you're saying you &amp; aliens are pro-vegetarian? // No. All food  consumed by humans (except salt) was once alive.
Aliens might be surprised to learn that in a cosmos w/ limitless starlight, humans kill for energy sources buried in the sand
Aliens might be surprised to see that humans consume mammary secretions of farm animals &amp; kill other living things to survive
Aliens might be surprised to learn that humans must lay semi-comatose on cushions for nearly a third of every Earth rotation.
.@boonamobile What's the Sun-Earth light travel time? // Sun's core to its surface: a half-million years. After that: 500 sec

A stunning thin crescent Moon graces the western skies this night. A feast for the eyes, suspended in twilight.
How many field goals in N/S stadiums flick the right upright's inside edge &amp; bounce backwards? Blame them on Earth's rotation
Coriolis force in N/S football stadiums always deflects field goals to the right: East for North kicks &amp; West for South kicks
Oops, @dopplershift noted that my Coriolis deflection was computed for the S. Hemisphere, where they don't play Am.Football.
.@bigalrosario: Does @neiltyson know these things? Or have to Google them? Either way I appreciate it. // I calculate them.
The Coriolis force comes from Earth's rotation, and it's what deflects clouds from North-South movement into circular storms.
FYI: A 50-yd FieldGoal on N/S grids such as Denver #Broncos Mile High Stadium deflects 0.4 inch due to Earth's Coriolis force
If trees could walk, I'd bet they, and not we, would rule the world.

Merry Perihelion to all. In its annual oval orbit, Earth swings closer to the Sun today than at any other time of the year.
Uh oh. In addition to SyFy Channel's airing of Twilight Zone, BBC America is running a Doctor Who marathon. A geek's dilemma.
Hold all calls: SyFy airing its New Year's Twilight Zone Marathon, putting me on watch for all aliens who want To Serve Man.
FYI: Earth is larger &amp; more reflective than the Moon, so full Earth on the Moon is about 40x brighter than full Moon on Earth
Crossing the sky at a much higher angle, winter full Moons are, on average, brighter than are summer ones.
Haven't done a formal test, but seems that 80% of the time I try to insert a USB plug into my laptop I get it the wrong way.
Actually, since days of the week are named for Gods, I instead bid "Happy Day 359" to all Atheists &amp; Agnostics of the world.
To all Christians of the world: "Merry Christmas."  To Jews, Muslims, &amp; everybody else not expecting Santa: "Happy Tuesday."
Random Santa Fact: Another casualty of global warming -- as the poles melt, most would rather not see Santa in a bathing suit
When Earth's oil runs out &amp; price of other fuels rises then naughty children will thank Santa for giving them a lump-of-coal
RandomSantaFact: Red-orange lights penetrate fog particles better than blue light. So Rudolph's nose is perfect for the task.
Santa surely keeps track of how many hours pass &amp; how long the Elf union allows them to work, but time of day has no meaning.
Random Santa Fact: Longitude lines border Time Zones. So at the North Pole, where all lines meet, clock time has no meaning.
Every great journey begins with a single step, except if you've got a rocket. Then, it's the single step that ends it.

It's just Math: If two candidates are actually dead-even in votes, each will win about half of all "too-close-to-call" polls.

Dear @MarsCuriosity, Bummer. You travel through space at seven miles per second, only to drive around on Mars at 1.5 inches per second.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, You're the size of an SUV, but with six wheels. What's the fastest that you can move?
Dear @MarsCuriosity,  After you land on Mars, what's your life expectancy?  (I hope somebody alerted you that we're not bringing you back.)
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Scientists conceived you, engineers designed you. But seriously, who do you like better, Scientists or Engineers?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, What's your favorite experiment that you will conduct on Mars?Or is that likepicking your favorite child?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, How autonomous are you? When you get to Mars can you just go six-wheeling around as you please?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Did you enjoy long periods of silence while travelling through space, or was JPL always trying to talk toyou?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, So you're being subjected to ionizing radiation from space?  You're not only a robot, you're a guinea pig.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, You've been traveling for nine months. How did you pass your time? Did they let you play "Angry Birds Space"?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Wait a minute. You travelled a 100-million miles in space &amp; hit an area 12x4 miles? Cool. Way better than a hole-in-one
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Are all your parts working as they should? Anything you're not telling us back here on Earth? (I won't tell JPL.)
Dear @MarsCuriosity, You call EDL 7-minutes of terror. Sure, to you. But to us on Earth, it's 7 minutes + 15 minutes signal time.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, What's the size of your landing spot on Mars? Is it small? It's a whole planet, I'd be happy just to land anywhere.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, just as I suspected. An element named after Pluto. Discovered when everyone thought the little iceball was a planet.
Dear @MarsCuriosity, What exactly is giving power to your Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, How does it feel out there as you near planet Mars? Are you Cold? Hot?Or just right?
Dear @MarsCuriosity, Neil deGrasse Tyson here on Earth, tweeting you, via a wormhole, through deep space.  Do you copy?
The day we stop exploring is the day we commit ourselves to live in a stagnant world, devoid of curiosity, empty of dreams.
Mars on my mind...Thinking of forging a wormhole through the Twitterverse and having a conversation with the Rover en route.
Just an FYI: Michael Phelps has as many Medals in the #Olympics - all time - as the country of India, with 1.2 billion people
Congratulations to all medal winners in the 2012 #Olympics: Gold Silver &amp; Bronze (copper+tin). All forged in exploding Stars
Weightlifters, whose sole job is to raise barbells from planets that attracts them, on Mars achieve 2.6x their personal bests
Gymnastics: On Mars, with only 38% of Earth's gravity, the Vault &amp; other spring-assisted leaps would resemble circus cannons.
Women's BeachVolleyball on Mars: No protective ozone layer there. Solar UV would irradiate all exposed legs, buns, &amp; tummies
Rowing on Mars would log about the same race times. There's hardly any movement with or against the 62% lower gravity there.
With 1% of Earth's air density, Badminton on Mars would be different -- a shuttlecock to the face lands you in the hospital.
Like to Kayak white waters? Valles Marineris on Mars is nearly 10x the length of Arizona's Grand Canyon.
If there was Cycling on Mars, try Olympus Mons -- a volcanic mountain 5x taller than Mont Blanc in the Alps.
If there was Swimming on Mars, the low temperature &amp; low air pressure would force the pool to simultaneously freeze &amp; boil.
How about a Mars #Olympics? Yes, all athletes would suffocate. Ignoring that complication -- way cooler than Earth #Olympics.
The #MarsScienceLaboratory arrives at the RedPlanet in the middle of the #Olympics back here on Earth. Hmmm...
In three days, a robotic emissary arrives &amp; lands on Mars to perform science experiments. That's just a sweet sentence to say

I'm often asked whether I believe in Global Warming.  I now just reply with the question: "Do you believe in Gravity?"
Oceans, LakeBeds, Mines, GroceryStores, Blood Sweat &amp; Tears, Exploding Stars. Sources of sodium+chloride when you need it.
FIFA is surely 5 on the list. In spite of the UN, we still wage war. So science &amp; sports may be the only hope for the World.
What of the United Nations, you might ask? Perhaps it should be 1.5 on the list. Founded principally because Nations wage war
Top 4 collaborations of Nations: 1) The Waging of War, 2) International Space Station, 3) Large Hadron Collider, 4) Olympics.
Just an FYI:  If you removed all veins, arteries, &amp; capillaries from your body and laid them end to end, you will die.
.@JTKerk:I saw my first shooting star tonight. Happy for me? // No, I'm disappointed.  It means you've hardly ever looked up.

Careful observation reveals that players &amp; coaches of 3hr Baseball games spit at least 6-gal (24 liters) of saliva onto field
Hand-stitched balls, rubbing mud, leather mitts, wooden bats, pine tar. Baseball: a game untouched by modern materials.
FYI: Laws of physics show that it takes twice as much energy to throw a baseball 100 mph than it does to throw one at 70 mph.
Slowest pitch in Baseball to reach catcher? 30 mph, thrown at 45-deg angle. Any slower and at any other angle hits the ground
Does it disturb anyone else that "The Los Angeles Angels" baseball team translates directly to "The The Angels Angels"?
Curious that intent is assigned by announcers when a batter gets a hit. Yet 70% of the time the player can't get a hit at all
.@AllStarGame: Baseball is ideal for talking &amp; tweeting &amp; tracking stats. Only 30-min of actual playing time in a 3-hr game.
Never figured why the Foul Pole is called the Foul Pole when it's entirely in fair territory. Should be called the Fair Pole.
Baseball should track extraordinary plays that fielders can bank, and then credit against errors they might later commit.
In Baseball, if a pitch hits you on ball four, you should get to advance to second base.
You can play baseball on the airless Moon, but only if you find a way not to suffocate &amp; if you don't care about curve balls.
If baseball reported averages to 4 decimal places instead of 3, then a three-hundred hitter would be batting "three thousand"
In the 1960s, when we still dreamed, we named a dome, a baseball team, and even the artificial turf they played on "Astro"
Tonight's @AllStarGame compells me to Tweet what Baseball looks like through the lens of an astrophysicist...

Tonight: Earth reaches aphelion, the farthest from the Sun in its oval orbit. Astro-folks in USA celebrate it w/ fireworks.
In all countries I know, more of their citizens have come to live in America than Americans have left to live in theirs.
July 4 - Happy Birthday USA. Celebrating the day we declared Independence, and not the day we actually achieved it.
NewEngland, NewYork, NewHampshire, NewLondon, NewBrunswick, NewBedford... The British colonists in America had no imagination
The Higgs discovery makes me feel heavier already. What we need instead is the anti-Higgs. A particle that takes mass away.
But seriously, congrats to CERN on the Hiiggs discovery. Another particle in the pocket. Another forded frontier of Nature.
You just wait Europe, science in America will rise again -- some time this millennium.
On the day we reserve to tell ourselves America is great - July 4 - Europe reminds us that we suck at science. #HiggsBoson
Saw Spider-Man. The starless night skies were accurate. Not much is visible from NYC's light-polluted steel &amp; glass canyons.
Just saw Spiderman preview in @IMAX 3D. Directed by Marc Webb. Yup. The Director's last name is actually Webb.
.@IComeFromEarth: Do you notice the sky more than anything else in a film? // No. Sometimes I pay attention to the plot.
Just saw Ted. @SethMacFarlane cared enough to get the night sky over Boston correct. The rest of the movie must also be real.
What a Leap Second looks like in the USA Eastern Time Zone http://t.co/XCwpT7ul
Going to see @SethMacFarlane's Ted tonight.  I'm told there's a Night Sky scene in it.  I'll be on the lookout.
Today's LeapSecond across USA: 7:59:60pET / 6:59:60pCT / 5:59:60pMT / 4:59:60pPT. I'll be having a (small) glass of Champagne
.@fractal74 Pure GPS time, from 1980 onward, adds none of the 15 LeapSeconds since then. After today they'll be 16 secs ahead
How are Leap Seconds added? At the Prime Meridian, 12:00:00 normally follows 11:59:59pm but will instead follow 11:59:60pm
We could, in principle, re-define the length of the second each time. Instead, we wait until one accumulates and add it whole
A Bar-bet you can win tonight:  Today's Leap Second makes June 30, 2012 the longest 24-hour day of the year.
June 30, 2012: Today's final minute gets a LeapSecond. to account for sloshing tides on coastlines, slowing Earth's rotation.
If you seek only easy problems to solve, then ultimately, there'll be nothing about you to distinguish yourself from others.
I love the smell of the universe in the morning.
A bit of Astro Humor: If we ever send humans to the Sun, it's best to go at night.
First full day of summer -- longest daylight of the year. Which means days get shorter, not longer in summer. Do the Astro.
In England, many European festivals, &amp; at least one Shakespearean play, Summer Solstice is more sensibly called "Midsummer"
June 20  7:09pm ET.  Oh, and happy Winter Solstice to the 15% of Earth's human population that lives South of the Equator.
June 20  7:09pm ET. Geekspeak: Sun reaches north-most spot on ecliptic above celestial equator. Everyone else: Summer begins.
.@fmacanadaguy: Thoughts on Voyager 1 exiting the solar system, you ask? Yup. In 100,000 years it'll reach the nearest stars.
Just an FYI: Until the Methods &amp; Tools of science were developed, people hardly knew anything about anything.
.@NarcissusD: What's the monster star R136a1 made of, you ask? Like our Sun, it's mostly Hydrogen but with a bit more Helium.
.@NateWeeksLaw: Do we share DNA w /Plants &amp; Bacteria, you ask? Indeed we do.  A theme we'll address in Cosmos (Spring 2014).
Love the air-pressure physics of new punch-top cans. But unlike ketchup, I never knew beer had problems exiting its container
Time elapsed before the launch of a female astronaut:  USSR: 2 years.  China: 9 years.  USA: 21 years.
'@EdwardJack2: What year do we make contact w/Aliens?' Never. They've concluded there's no sign of intelligent life on Earth.
Jun 14. Flag Day in USA. In space, a frontier for all, there is no air, and so Flags do not wave. A lesson from the cosmos.

Prometheus: Two parts Cowboys&amp;Aliens, one part Mission To Mars, one part The Day The Earth Stood Still. Blend in the abdomen.
Prometheus goes 35 light yrs into space, but CharlizeTheron gaffes "We're a half billion miles from Earth"- just past Jupiter
Attended a midnight showing of Prometheus. The takeaway? Occasions arise when being curious is bad for your life expectancy.

Wouldn't it be cool if, right about now, silhouettes of spaceships were seen escaping Venus, visible against the glowing Sun.
Space Shuttle Endeavour, soon to rest at the Cal Sci Center, was named for Captain Cook's ship - hence the British spelling.
Captain Cook saw the June 3, 1769 Venus Transit from South Pacific, also mapping islands there for later British colonization
Venus Transit is historically significant because you can derive the solar system's size from precision timing of the event.
In the era of the Telescope, there's been 258 Total Solar Eclipses but only eight Venus Transits, including today's.
Venus transits are long &amp; boring -- but rare. Every 110 years, or so, they typically come in pairs, separated by eight years.
Kepler Telescope looks for similar brightness drops in search of exoplanets crossing our lines of sight to their host stars.
Later today, for nearly six hours, sunlight we receive dims by 0.1% as Venus crosses Earth's line of sight to the Sun.
Venus on my mind...
GettingMarried? June's full Moon crosses the sky in a low arc. Atmospheric dust creates an Amber hue. Behold the "HoneyMoon"

TrajectoryPhysics: Slowest pitch in Baseball to reach catcher? 30mph at 45deg angle. Any slower at another angle hits ground
Energy scales as velocity squared, so it twice as much of it to throw a baseball 100mph than to throw one at 70mph.
My five favorite physicists, in order:  Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein, Galileo Galileo, James Clerk Maxwell, Richard Feynman.
Energy scales as velocity squared, so it takes half again as much of it to throw a baseball 100mph than to throw one at 80mph

Kryptonite, the only cosmic substance that can harm Superman, comes in the same radiant GREEN as GreenLantern's power rings.
From a rainbow, GREEN is Roy G. Biv's middle name. Red Orange Yellow GREEN Blue Indigo Violet.
The "GREEN" movement might be misnamed. Experiments show increased CO2 promotes photosynthesis, making plants grow faster.
The "GREENFlash" is not a superhero but a rare spectral phenomenon of setting Sun. Best viewed at sea thru a calm atmosphere.
The Hulk is GREEN from a potent, accidental dose of Gamma Rays. Actually, he would have died within weeks from organ failure.
Our eyes are about 10x more sensitive to GREEN light than Red. So watt-for-watt GREEN lasers look much brighter than Red ones
By the 1920s the GREEN-emitting element nebulium was ID'ed as oxygen, but behaving oddly in the rarefied conditions of space.
Mid-19th century, a mysterious element was discovered in galactic nebulae. It emanated deep GREEN. Dubbed "nebulium"
The peak sensitivity of the Human Retina is GREEN, matching the peak spectral output of the Sun.
The Sun emits more GREEN light than any other band of light in the rainbow.
Curiously, light-loving GREEN plants reject the Sun's GREEN light, reflecting it back at you, which is why they look GREEN.
The laws of physics conspire to prevent GREEN stars in the universe. They basically come in three colors: Red, White, &amp; Blue.
A cosmic romance on the color GREEN follows shortly

Area of a pizza (or any circle), is pi times radius squared. Volume of a pizza (or any cylinder) is the Area times the depth.
Of course the volume of that pizza is: V = pi zz a   @Maz_Man_Utd: what about pizza volume if radius = z and thickness = a?
A 14 inch diameter gets you 154 square inches; a 10 inch gives 78 square inches; and a 7 inch, 38 square inches - of Pizza pi
If Pizza sizes were given in area not diameter, you'd see instantly that a 7 inch is less than half the size of a 10 inch pie

Earth's (remaining) glaciers & cloud cover greatly boost our reflectivity. The Moon is about as reflective as tire-rubber.
In case you were curious: being larger & more reflective, full Earth on the Moon is 40x brighter than full Moon on Earth.
Just an FYI: Crossing the sky at much higher angles, winter full Moons appear, on average, brighter than summer full Moons.
This January eve, in a line across the sky, find Venus in twilight, moonrise in the east, and Jupiter up on high.

So, contrary to popular suspicion, seasons have nothing whatsoever to do with Earth's slowly varying distance from the Sun.
But In July, Earth's Sun-tipped axis gives N. Hemisphere's middle latitudes a factor of 5x more sunlight than in January.
During its January close-approach to the Sun, Earth receives about 7% more sunlight than it does during July's far-approach.

Earth's Coriolis force - in which low latitudes speed around Earth's axis faster than high latitudes - drives all hurricanes.
In N/S stadiums, the Coriolis force deflects a football to the right for a North kick and to the left for a South kick.
FYI: 50yd FieldGoals on N/S grids like @Denver_Broncos MileHighStadium deflect nearly 1/2 inch due to Earth's Coriolis force.
6) Conversation with the Science Network, on Life, the Universe, and Everything: [1 hr] bit.ly/krXqQ1

SleepWell in 2012: Niburu is fiction; no Solar Max; Dec21 alignment occurs every yr; Mayan failed to predict their own demise
Wow. I can remember the year 2011 as though it were yesterday.
FYI:NewYear celebrations begin 6hr too early per yr, relative to Earth's orbital return spot. The 4yr leapday corrects for it
Odd that we mark the New Year's exact moment - a fresh Earth orbit - yet celebrate it one time zone after another, 24 times
Geek Heaven -- New Year's Eve: Two marathons, one night -- SyFy channel's "Twilight Zone" and TBS's "The Big Bang Theory".
.@jbg7 Concerned about which way "up" really is? "Up" is every direction away from Earth's center. That's the entire cosmos.
As 2011 draws to a close, I remind us all that in life and in the universe, it is always best to keep looking up.
Good to see Apollo 11's Buzz Aldrin in a cameo spot. Yes, long ago, in a country that once was, astronauts visited the Moon.
In any case, in Transformers III, it was good to see Optimus Prime kicking bot.
Transformers III was 45m too long. There's no Dark Side of the Moon. And Apollo 11's Lunar Module was still on its launch pad
Just caught up with Transformers III. The bots tear up Chicago. About time an action film destroys a city other than New York

When you can see the crescent Moon's unlit part it's called "Earthshine," but I've always preferred to call it "Moonshine"
Can you see the whole Moon in the arm's of the crescent? It's sunlight bounced off full-Earth, then the Moon, then back to us
After Venus and the Moon sink low in the west, look south and high, for Jupiter at its best.
Stunning thin crescent moon joins Venus this night, look low in the west during evening's twilight.
10 tweets in 1 day. Last did that for a shuttle launch. Please don't come to expect it. My preferred rate is a few per week.
...and why during sunset, when light passes through the most atmospheric crud, the Sun looks deep red & the sky, deep violet.
That's also why the daytime Sun looks yellow-ish and the surrounding sky looks "sky" blue.
And that's why a car (or truck's) fog lights are amber -- a color that penetrates the fog to illuminate the road.
That's why a car's blueish high-beams are useless in fog - light scatters within to offer an excellent view of the fog itself
Long wavelength red-orange part of the spectrum passes thru fog/dust/pollen while short wavelength blue-violet gets scattered
Newton showed that white light (like sunlight) is composed of a rainbow of colors: Red-Orange-Yellow-Green-Blue-Violet.
Some unfinished business regarding Rudolph's nose -- in six tweets...
.@rna11y You want to celebrate Newton's b'day Dec 25 (1642)? He was born Jan 4, 1643, on the Gregorian calendar in use today.
I suppose the Christmas carol lyric "Go, Tell It On The Mountain, Over the hills & everywhere" would today be "Send a Tweet"
Christians: MerryChristmas; Jews & Muslims: HappySunday; Atheists & Agnostics: HappyDay359 (Days of week are named for gods)
Red light cuts thru fog better than white. So if Rudolph's nose did glow he'd indeed prevent Santa from flying into mountains
Nope. I'm cool with the flying reindeer. RT @sarnoski: That's what get you? Not the flying reindeer?
According to the song, Rudolph's nose is shiny, which means it reflects rather than emits light. Useless for navigating fog.
Seems that by now, given Santa's body weight & shape, hungry PolarBears would have mistaken him for a seal and eaten him.
FYI: As the world warms & the Arctic melts, the PolarBear is not the only one to lose a habitat. Santa also gets cast adrift.
.@SethMacFarlane Speaking of Superman, if he's really made of indestructible stuff, seems to me he wouldn't need big muscles.
Dec 22, 2011, 12:30amET. Earth's N.Pole angles away from the Sun's glow, casting Winter above the Equator, and Summer below.

Apparently, servers over-loaded with that Colbert interview link.  Sorry about that.  Just keep trying.
Stunning thin crescent Moon graces twilight this day. With cloud-shrouded Venus nearby, brightly reflecting sunlight our way.
Obedience hardly ever begets innovation.
Behold a majestic moonless night: Orion the Hunter rising high. Led by Jupiter in its brilliance, across the darkened sky.
Thanksgiving dinner, a few years ago, each in turn thanked God for food. I thanked scientists for improved farming. Got booed
FYI: All terrestrial Helium comes from hydrogen fusion in reactors & the radioactive decay of heavy elements in Earth's crust
Macy's Thanksgiving Parade is the 2nd largest user of helium in world. It's good for balloons & for sounding like MickeyMouse
The Big Bang birthed our universe with ten percent helium atoms. None of them are in the Macy's Thanksgiving parade balloons.
.@Cazhary You'd age a tad slower on Mercury from a higher speed around the Sun. But you'd also vaporize. Not a good tradeoff.

Scientists in the Elements:  Curium Bohrium Lawrencium Einsteinium Fermium Seaborgium Rutherfordium Meitnerium & Copernicium
The "big" asteroids Ceres and Pallas each have elements in their honor as well:  cerium & palladium.
Pluto got an element named after it -- plutonium -- on false pretense.
More cosmic objects: Uranus (uranium), Neptune (neptunium), Pluto (plutonium) -- appearing in sequence on the Periodic Table.
Cosmic objects with elements named in their honor:   Sun (helium), Mercury (mercury), Earth (telerium), Moon (selenium)
An element was discovered in the Sun before it was found on Earth. Named in honor of the Greek sun god Helios: "Helium"
Gotta love the Periodic Table of the Elements - that mysterious chart of boxes that hung in your High School chemistry class.

If baseball reported averages to four decimal places, instead of three, then a perfect hitter would be batting "ten thousand"
Just an FYI: It takes twice as much energy to throw a baseball 100mph than it does to throw one at 70mph. Do The Physics
The "ManagerOfTheYear" award should not be a vote, but should go to who gets the most wins per dollar of player salaries paid
On the Moon, with 1/6 of Earth's gravity, a 400 ft home run would travel nearly half a mile. Do the physics.
If you walk on 4 pitches it should count against the pitcher. But if you walk on 8 pitches, it should count as a hit.
Baseball should track extraordinary plays that fielders can bank, and then credit against errors they might later commit.
New baseball rules I'd like to see: if the pitch that hits you is ball four, you should get to advance to second base.
You can play baseball on the airless Moon, but only if you find a way not to suffocate & if you don't care about curve balls

Northerners who visit there praise southern skies not because the stars are better but because the skies are darker.

Southern Cross is surely misnamed.  Four stars only - a crooked square. Perhaps it should be called the "Southern Rhombus"

Successful launch to orbit for Atlantis STS-135. Have a good day, Twitterverse. Thanks for sharing your slice of it with me.
11:29 am ET - Liftoff at the Cape.  Godspeed Atlantis astronauts.
Apollo in 1969. Shuttle in 1981. Nothing in 2011. Our space program would look awesome to anyone living backwards thru time.
Not much Grump left within me.  But perhaps I can eek out one more...
The entire half-century budget of NASA equals the current two year budget of the US military.
The US military spends as much in 23 days as NASA spends in a year - and that's when we're not fighting a war.
The US bank bailout exceeded the half-century lifetime budget of NASA.
NASA costs Americans half a penny on a tax dollar. That fraction of a bill is not wide enough from the edge to reach the ink.
Just an FYI: Human access to space doesn't end with the Shuttle era, only American access. China and Russia still go there.
When JFK committed America to land on the Moon, his projected date would have fallen under his watch as a 2-term President.
Obama promises a future of NASA with trips to Mars on a time frame that exceeds his tenure as a 2-term President.
If Earth were size of a school-room globe, our atmosphere wouldn't be much thicker than the coat of lacquer on its surface.
If Earth were size of a school-room globe, you'd find Shuttle and Space Station orbiting 3/8th of an inch above its surface.
If Earth were the size of a school-room globe, the Moon would be 30-ft away. Mars, more than a mile away.
Space Arithmetic:  Mercury + Gemini + Apollo = 10 years.  Shuttle = 30 years.
Many lament the shuttle era's end.  But it was boldly going where hundreds had gone before. Time to go new places.
FYI:  Commercial Space Flight will not advance the space frontier, but enable cheaper access to where we've already been.
Other than the waging of War, the ISS (assembled by Shuttle) is the most successful collaboration of nations there ever was.
No. I'm not in Florida for the launch today. I'm a much bigger fan of when things begin than of when they end.
A reminder that nobody lamented the end of Gemini because Apollo was set to launch from the pad next-door.
Many lament the shuttle era's end. But that's misplaced sentiment. Lament instead the absence of an era to replace it.
Shuttle mission in the film "Space Cowboys" was STS-200.  With the launch of Atlantis, the actual program reaches only STS-135
The inability to predict weather across 5- days is chaos. The inability to predict weather across 5-hours is ignorance.
Chance of storms delaying Shuttle Launch: 70%. Reminder that we comprehend weather only well enough to predict statistically.

.@adamyantastic Do I ever reply to "mentions" you ask? On occasion. Even when I'm asked if I ever reply to "mentions"
Yup. One can never tire of the physics of light.
Time delay moves hottest time of day a few hrs after "high" noon & hottest time of yr a month or two after 1st day of summer.
So, Sun's visible light doesn't heat air, it heats ground. Ground then re-radiates IR, which heats the air - a little later.
Air is transparent to visible light, where Sun's energy peaks. That's why we can see the Sun & each other thru atmosphere.
Just an FYI: Counting hours of sunlight?  For every day of Summer there's a matching day in Spring w/ same hours of daylight.

The urge to leave work early and avoid traffic is strong on Fridays. Most do it and become the traffic they sought to avoid.
.@DJCharlieBlac Light of all kinds (UV, IR, Micro, Radio, etc)  passes thru the vacuum, handing energy to whatever absorbs it
.@paridine How does heat move thru the vacuum of space, you ask? Where there's no medium, light alone carries the energy.
JustAnFYI: I wrote about false FullMoon correlations & other cosmic curiosities in 'UniverseDownToEarth" http://bit.ly/kinN8V
Ten FullMoons equals human gestation period (295 days). So if you're born under a FullMoon you're likely conceived under one.
.@wintersunllc Do FullMoons affect ovulation, you ask? Cycles: Human Female 28d. FullMoon 29.5d. They'd decorrelate in 10mos.
Geek kids joke of the day --  RT @ObsidianCrane:  How does a barber cut the Moon's hair? He eclipse it.
Astrophysicists do not fear the dark because telescopes reveal the night to be ablaze with bands of light our eyes cannot see

Relativity101: Travel faster than others & time ticks more slowly. Returning astronauts are younger than they'd otherwise be.
.@_erica_h07 Bummed Houston gets no shuttle? Is MissionControl & SaturnV not enough? Time to spread the love. NASA needs it.
Einstein's relativity shows that Endeavour astronauts moved 1/2000 sec into the future during their stay in orbit.
Sorry, mild error in my Endeavour Relativity Tweet.  Corrected now...
.@IHaveAGoatee How does shuttle slow down on landing, you ask?  Air friction. Tire friction. Drogue chute. Brakes, if needed.
Good Day World. Good Night America. Signing off. At least until more tweets of cosmic significance gurgle up within me.
Welcome home Astronauts: 248orbits. 6,510,221mi; Well done Endeavour: 25missions. 4,671orbits. 123,883,151 miles on odometer.
Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle's landing strip is 15,000 feet long. Long enough for the brakeless Orbiter to coast to a stop.
The SpaceShuttle alone has no engines. Fuel tanks on launch were all rented. Below Mach-1 Endeavour lands as a simple glider.
For most of Endeavour's re-entry, it's a ballistic brick falling from the sky. Below the speed of sound, it's aerodynamic.
When moving faster than sound, forward directed waves pile atop one another, greatly magnifying their volume: A Sonic Boom.
I'm in good company RT @RealNichelle: Mine too! RT @neiltyson My favorite shuttle? ENTERPRISE. Named for Capt Kirk's starship
Protective Shuttle tiles reach thousands of degrees (F), persistently radiating heat away. Shielding the astronauts within.
Mostly buried, Chicxulub crater of the Yucatan Peninsula was made 65million yrs ago, leaving the world's dinosaurs extinct.
FYI:  On approach to its Florida runway, Endeavour will pass directly over the Chicxulub crater from the KT asteroid impact.
As Endeavour dips into Earth's atmosphere, the surrounding air heats up, whisking away the Shuttle's energy of motion.
.@davidleyman Define a "scad" you ask?  Officially, it's more than a bunch, but less than a boatload.
As Endeavour's speed slows, it drops lower in Earth's atmosphere, encountering an ever-increasing density of air molecules.
Shuttle takes 1/2 of Earth's circumference to drop 200 miles out of the sky. Slowing from 17,200mph orbit to 220mph landing
Shuttle now executing a "de-orbit burn" dropping its path low enough to meetscads of motion-impeding air molecules.
Just an FYI: To land, Space Shuttle Endeavour must lose all the energy of motion that it gained during launch.
